                <small>OUR PEOPLE</small>
                <h2>About our Dental Hygienist</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-6 offset-lg-12">
                      <p> I am a dental hygienist registered with the College of Dental
                        Hygienists of Ontario (CDHO). My relevant educational background
                        includes an Associate of Applied Science (dental hygiene) and a
                        Bachelor of Science (psychology).</p>

                     <p> I began my career working in general family dentistry and in
                       dental clinics specializing in treatment of gum disease. I had the
                       good fortune of working along-side many dentists, dental hygienists
                       and other oral care professionals who were exceptionally passionate
                       and skilled practitioners. It was under the mentorship of these
                       dedicated professionals, that I developed and honed my clinical
                       skills and knowledge.</p>

                    <p> I then moved my practice away from the traditional dentist’s
                      clinic toward a novel and exciting way of providing oral health
                      care known as “independent dental hygiene”. With this new way of
                      practice, came the ability for dental hygienists to provide key
                      components of the dental hygiene appointment without prior
                      authorization from a dentist; essentially, hygienists were now free
                      to work independent of the dentist. This brought vast new possibilities
                      for the profession of dental hygiene, and more importantly, improved choice
                      and access to oral health and dental care for the client. </p>

                  <p> I created a mobile dental hygiene clinic travelling to individuals
                    and families facing social & economic, physical & developmental or
                    emotional barriers to treatment at the dental office. I met some of
                    the most resilient and amazing people who taught me great life-lessons
                    in cultivating human compassion, acceptance, gratitude and how to truly
                    listen and gain knowledge from each other. I learned how embracing these
                    qualities in my practice could enrich the experience for both myself and
                    my clients. </p>

                <p> My latest venture involves bringing independent dental hygiene to
                  residents and businesses at our location in Toronto’s Liberty Village.
                  At Liberty Dental Hygiene, I aim to offer you not only flexibility and
                  freedom of choice, but to also bring together the clinical foundation
                  gained from years of practice, with those invaluable life-lessons, into every appointment. </p>

               <p> I hope to give you a superior experience. </p>

                            <h3>Teeth Whitening</h3>
                            <p class="lead">Professional teeth whitening is one of our most requested procedures due to the great demand for youthful, healthy, bright smiles.</p>
                            <p>The outer enamel layer of our teeth is porous and permeable. Over time, dark staining from foods and beverages, becomes absorbed and trapped beneath the enamel surface resulting in dull, grey or yellow teeth. Once this occurs,
                              regular dental polishing cannot reach the deep staining to restore teeth to their original luster and brightness.
                            </p>
                            <p>Teeth whitening work with the application of hydrogen peroxide-based agents on the surface of teeth. The product travels beneath the enamel, interacts with the trapped stain and eliminates it, leaving a whiter, brighter and more attractive smile.
                            </p>
                            <p>As teeth whitening is immensely popular, there are numerous systems available to meet this demand. However, not every product is suitable for every client. It is best to consult a licensed oral care professional to discuss the various teeth whitening formulations, their safety, and their effectiveness.
                            </p>
                            <p>Book a consultation with our hygienist to determine which of our various teeth whitening systems that is right for you!</p>

                            <p>Many of us have experienced annoying symptoms of teeth sensitivity from time to time. These can be described as short bursts of mild to intense stabbing sensation coming from the teeth when they are touched, exposed to temperature changes or to different types of foods.
Some causes of teeth sensitivity are exposed roots related to receding gums, or worn-down tooth surfaces. Other factors for sensitivity include loss of mineralization in the enamel or even dental decay.
Treatments for teeth sensitivity range from regular use of store-bought toothpastes aimed at reducing sensitivity to professional in-office teeth desensitization with a licensed oral care professional such as a dental hygienist.
If you are experiencing symptoms of teeth sensitivity, book a consultation with our dental hygienist to uncover the cause of your sensitivity and to choose the treatment that is best for you!

                            <p class="lead">Custom Fitted Sports Guards</p>
                            <p> For those of us who enjoy playing sports, injuries to the mouth, jaw and head are always a risk. These include chipping, breaking, or loss of teeth, jaw joint damage, and sometimes brain concussion. These injuries are often the result of impact to the lower jaw where the energy force dissipates though the teeth, jaws and skull resulting in pain & recovery time, and even an expensive dental bill.
A well fitted sports-guard is your best defense to mouth, jaw and head injuries as the appliance is designed to cushion and absorb the forces of impact reducing your chance of serious trauma.
A custom sports guard fabricated by an oral care professional is fitted just for you and provides superior protection over generic/universal store-bought mouth protectors. An ideal guard offers good self-retention in the mouth, covers all teeth in the arch, does not cut or pinch the mouth, and easily allows for speech, swallowing and breathing.
Make that appointment with our dental hygienist to get fitted for your custom sports guard. It’s well worth it!
